            In today’s threat environment, it’s not just a good idea to conduct
            a cybersecurity vulnerability assessment, and to do so on a regular
            basis – it’s a core requirement for any organization that wants to
            protect critical data and ensure that its networks and systems
            aren’t exposed to cyberattacks.

              <span className="text-secondary"> QODES Systems </span> provides
              deep insights on security deficiencies in an environment and helps
              to evaluate a system’s vulnerability to a specific threat and the
              evolving ones. Simply put, an organization can fully understand
              the security flaws, overall risk, and assets that are vulnerable
              to cybersecurity breaches. To stay protected and to counter
              surprise attacks, a thorough vulnerability assessment can fix the
              unattended security issues.

            Basically, a vulnerability assessment applies various methods,
            tools, and scanners to find out grey areas, threats, and risks.
            Everything depends on how well the weakness in the given systems is
            discovered to attend to that specific need. Find below different
            types of vulnerability assessment scans:

            Going by the name, it helps identify possible network security
            attacks. The scan helps zero-in the vulnerable systems on wired or
            wireless networks.

            services are examined vigorously. It also provides excellent
            visibility into the configuration settings and patch history of
            scanned systems.

            Vulnerability assessments allow security teams to apply a
            consistent, comprehensive, and clear approach to identifying and
            resolving security threats and risks. This has several benefits to
            an organization:

            HOW VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS RELATE TO IT RISK AND VULNERABILITY
            MANAGEMENT
          </h2>
          <p className="text-wrap text-black text-[17px] leading-6">
            A vulnerability assessment explores a wide range of potential issues
            across multiple networks, systems, and other parts of your IT
            ecosystem, on-prem and cloud. It identifies weaknesses that need
            correction, including misconfigurations and policy non-compliance
            vulnerabilities that patching and maintenance alone may not address.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p className="text-wrap text-black text-[17px] leading-6">
          Most vulnerability assessments assign a risk to each threat. These
          risks can have a priority, urgency, and impact assigned to them, which
          makes it easier to focus on those that could create the most issues
          for an organization. This is an important part of vulnerability
          management, as your IT security team will have limited time and
          resources, and must concentrate on the areas that could cause the most
          damage to your business.F
        </p>
        <p className="text-wrap text-black text-[17px] leading-6">
          The information provided by a vulnerability assessment helps IT teams,
          as well as automated third-party tools (i.e. patch management), to
          prioritize vulnerabilities and chart the path for action, which often
          means remediation. However, sometimes organization choose to accept
          the continuance of the risk. For instance, if the uncovered
          vulnerability is of low potential impact and of low likelihood, but on
          the other hand, fixing it would require downtime or potential breaking
          of other systems, IT may determine the vulnerability risk is less than
          the risk posed to ongoing IT operations. This is how vulnerability
          assessments fall into an overarching IT risk management framework.
